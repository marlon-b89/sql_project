    LIMIT 10
) 
SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim on skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```

### 3. What skills are the most in-demand for data analysts?
Reviewed a comparative view of how frequently each skill is required, emphasizing the key areas of focus for those looking to enhance their expertise in the data analytics field.
```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim on skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE  
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location LIKE '%New York%'
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY 
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 4. Which skills are associated with the highest salaries?
The variety of skills and their corresponding salaries demonstrate a dynamic and diverse technology landscape where data analysis, machine learning, programming, and infrastructure management are highly valued. 

![Skills associated with High Salary](/data_analyst_jobs_project/assets/04_Skills_Job_Table.png)
```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 2) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim on skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE  
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_location LIKE '%New York%'
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY 
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

### 5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
The scatter plot above represents the demand and average salary for various top skills. Each point on the graph corresponds to a specific skill, with its position determined by the demand count (horizontal axis) and average salary (vertical axis). The size of each point indicates the demand count, providing a visual representation of both the popularity and the value of each skill in the job market. Here are some key observations:
- SQL remains a highly demanded skill with a relatively high average salary, positioned significantly on the graph.
- Express has the highest average salary among the skills plotted, despite a lower demand, indicating its niche but lucrative nature.
- Python, Tableau, and Excel show strong demand with high average salaries, underscoring their importance in data-related professions.
